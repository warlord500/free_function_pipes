In rust, it is common to compose functions together; however, to compose functions together, you have option one of dealing with lots of nested parenthesis or option two; you commonly use the method syntax. 

the library creates traits that apply to every type, 
that allow "piping" data through, a free function or closure
in a method chain without breaking the format of a method chain.

also, this code adds a trait called pipModer, that additionally,
allows chaining functions, that return unit but modify self,
by returning Self.
